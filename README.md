# webpack-setup
simple webpack5 setUp example 

1. with >webpack 4 there is no configuration needed for setting up the project. This is great!!
2. It needs to creat src folder for us, then move all the JS file inside that src folder.
3. Then we can run "npx webpack" to see the dist folder getting created.
